    "described how to import and work with Python libraries and functions.\n",

    "## 2.1 Python Syntax Style\n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax follows sets of styles and layouts described by the Python\n",
    "Software Foundation in a document called “PEP 8 -- Style Guide for\n",
    "Python Code”. Probably, the most distinctive principle of the Python\n",
    "code layout is its use of indentation. In simple words, indentation is a\n",
    "blank space at the start of each line in a code, which means to start a\n",
    "new line of code further in the left compared with a previous line. In\n",
    "Python, an indentation is used to mark and define each block of code\n",
    "from other blocks in rest of the code. Every time a new block of code is\n",
    "about to start, it should indent to the left (its lines start further in\n",
    "left) compared with lines in a previous block. Then, all the lines in\n",
    "that block should line up vertically in a way that they all have the\n",
    "same distance to the left at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PEP 8 document suggests that each line of code in Python being\n",
    "limited to 79 characters, except for docstrings or comments, which in\n",
    "those cases it suggests limiting each line to 72 characters. In a case\n",
    "that a line of code becomes longer than a suggested length, it can be\n",
    "split into two or more lines by using a backslash, \\\\. In Python, a\n",
    "backslash is used for a line continuation (a line break). In general,\n",
    "any line of Python code (regardless of its length) can be split into two\n",
    "or more lines by using a backslash at the end of each line. Here is an\n",
    "example of how to use a backslash for a line continuation. In this\n",

    "Python has specific naming rules for variable names. Here are rules that\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Variable names can consist of letters (both uppercase, A-Z, and\n",
    "    lowercase, a-z), digits (0-9), and an underscore character (\\_).\n",
    "-   Variable names can have any length.\n",
    "-   Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore, \\_.\n",

    "-   Variable names cannot be the same as Python keywords. To check if a\n",
    "    name is a Python keyword, the keyword.iskeyword('...') function may\n",
    "    be used. The keyword.kwlist function returns all Python keywords.\n",

    "    avoid using both of them in the same code.\n",
    "-   Space is not allowed in variable names. Therefore, space cannot be\n",

    "## 2.2 Python Built-in Functions, Standard Libraries, and Third-Party Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with built-in functions, standard libraries, and constants.\n",
    "All built-in functions are loaded at the moment Python starts and become\n",
    "available to use. Here are some of the Python built-in functions: abs(),\n",
    "int(), len(), list(), map(), max(), min(), open(), print(), range(), and\n",

    "libraries, first, it should be loaded by using the import command. Any\n",
    "of these standard libraries includes a series of modules and functions\n",
    "which developed to conduct specific tasks. After a library imported, all\n",
    "associated functions in that library become available to use (for more\n",
    "information refer to a section on importing a library). Some of the\n",
    "Python standard libraries are: datetime, math, os, random, re,\n",
    "statistics, and sys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, Python comes with pre-defined constants. The most commonly\n",
    "used Python built-in constants are True, False, and None. Also, Python\n",
    "has a series of keywords such as if, for, and while.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are tons of popular third-party libraries for Python.\n",
    "Unlike the standard libraries that come pre-installed with Python, the\n",

    "import command before it can be used.\n",

    "When it comes to data analysis and scientific computing, there are a\n",
    "couple of well-known third-party libraries that are essential to have.\n",
    "First, is the NumPy library (Oliphant, 2006; www.numpy.org) which\n",
    "provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices as well as\n",
    "advanced mathematical functions. Second, is the SciPy library (Virtanen\n",
    "et al. 2020; www.scipy.org) which contains modules for scientific\n",
    "computing such as optimization, interpolation, and signal processing.\n",
    "Third, is the Matplotlib library (Hunter, 2007; matplotlib.org) which is\n",
    "a plotting library for data visualizations. Fourth, is the Pandas\n",
    "library (McKinney, 2010; pandas.pydata.org) which is a package for\n",
